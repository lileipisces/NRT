# NRT (Neural Rating and Tips generation)
PyTorch re-implementation without review prediction task ([original implementation in Theano](https://github.com/lipiji/NRT-theano))

For those who are interested in how to obtain (feature, opinion, template, sentiment) quadruples, please refer to [Sentires-Guide](https://github.com/lileipisces/Sentires-Guide).

## Usage
Below is an example of how to run NRT.
```
python -u main.py \
--data_path ../TripAdvisor/reviews.pickle \
--index_dir ../TripAdvisor/1/ \
--cuda \
--checkpoint ./tripadvisor/ >> tripadvisor.log
```

## Code dependencies
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch 1.6

## Friendly reminders
- If you want to equip the model with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), please refer to [PEPLER](https://github.com/lileipisces/PEPLER).
- If you want to add the review prediction task back, please refer to the context prediction task in [PETER](https://github.com/lileipisces/PETER).
- If you want to change back to the original settings as reported in the paper (which would deteriorate the performance), please comment out line 92 and uncomment out line 93 in [main.py](main.py).
